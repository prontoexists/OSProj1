3/11/25 - Studied Vigenere Cypher and how it works. Brushed up on Python libraries/fundamentals. Plan currently is to read instructions, devise what tools need to be used to accomplish and how to proceed.

3/12/25 - Begin Encrpytion.py. Contains the neccessity functions of the overall project. Begin working on PASS and ENCRYPT functions

3/13/25 - Begin working on DECRYPT and QUIT functions. Refreshing from Python was ultimately a challenge, especially after not using it for so long.

3/14/25 - Begin working on RESULT and ERROR functions. Relatively short day, however, most of it was used studying the cypher and how to implement it into Python.
