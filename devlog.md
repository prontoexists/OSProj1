3/11/25 - Studied Vigenere Cypher and how it works. Brushed up on Python libraries/fundamentals. Plan currently is to read instructions, devise what tools need to be used to accomplish and how to proceed.

3/12/25 - Begin Encrpytion.py. Contains the neccessity functions of the overall project. Begin working on PASS and ENCRYPT functions

3/13/25 - Begin working on DECRYPT and QUIT functions. Refreshing from Python was ultimately a challenge, especially after not using it for so long.

3/14/25 - Begin working on RESULT and ERROR functions. Relatively short day, however, most of it was used studying the cypher and how to implement it into Python.

3/16/25 - Finished Encryption.py. Functions were relatively straightforward and basic. The only issue possible is if certain characters have errors printing but this is due possibly to the system.

3/17/25 - Begin Logger.py. Read instructions

3/18/25 - Begin the logger.py code. Biggest issue I had was dealing with the repeated whitespace and not having it lead to crashing or invalid syntax on the output. 

3/20/25 - FInished logger.py. Final step was ensuring that the logger output matched the date and time format that was provided by the instructions.

3/21/25 - Begin Driver.py. This is the final program that utilizes both logger and encryption programs. We create the password function and provide input for inclusion or from the history.

3/22/25 - Work on the encrypt function. Simple utilization of a menu provided me with the most troubles. I did not expect the PC taking a string from a value would be so tiresome. The output had to be saved in the history again too after encryption. Finished history function as well
